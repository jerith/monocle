earth.png was adapted form a sprite created by "Spriteman22" in the
Scratch community (http://scratch.mit.edu/users/Spriteman22/) - his
comments made it clear he expected it to be picked up, so here it's
being used slightly further afield than it perhaps expected.

march.it was composed by Joseph Toscano as part of the Pingus project;
I'm using it as a test file here under my understanding of the license
from Pingus's data itself.
